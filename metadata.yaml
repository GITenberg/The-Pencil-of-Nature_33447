description: "The Pencil of Nature, published in six installments between 1844 and\
  \ 1846, was the \"first photographically illustrated book to be commercially published\"\
  \ or \"the first commercially published book illustrated with photographs\". It\
  \ was wholly executed by the new art of Photogenic Drawing, without any aid whatever\
  \ from the artist's pencil and regarded as an important and influential work in\
  \ the history of photography. Written by William Henry Fox Talbot and published\
  \ by Longman, Brown, Green & Longmans in London, the book detailed Talbot's development\
  \ of the calotype process and included 24 calotype prints, each one pasted in by\
  \ hand, illustrating some of the possible applications of the new technology. Since\
  \ photography was still very much a novelty and many people remained unfamiliar\
  \ with the concept, Talbot felt compelled to insert the following notice into his\
  \ book:\n\nThe plates of the present work are impressed by the agency of Light alone,\
  \ without any aid whatever from the artist's pencil. They are the sun-pictures themselves,\
  \ and not, as some persons have imagined, engravings in imitation.\n\nThe cover\
  \ page for The Pencil of Nature clashed designs, which was characteristic of the\
  \ Victorian era, with styles inspired by baroque, Celtic, and medieval elements.\
  \ Its symmetrical design, letterforms, and intricate carpet pages are similar to\
  \ and a pastiche of the Book of Kells.\nThe Pencil of Nature was published and sold\
  \ one section at a time, without any binding (as with many books of the time, purchasers\
  \ were expected to have it bound themselves once all the installments had been released).\
  \ Talbot planned a large number of installments; however, the book was not a commercial\
  \ success and he was forced to terminate the project after completing only six.\n\
